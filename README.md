SITE Pre-Work Submission
Name: Bexzod Abduvaliev

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   None

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   I did not really find this assignment challenging.
   The only problem I had was the win game condition not working properly.
   I realized that comparing progress to the length of the pattern array was wrong and
   that it should be compared to the lenght of the pattern array - 1.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I see and hear a lot about different things like node.js or angular.js and I am not sure what they are.
   I know how HTML, CSS, and Javascript work together to make a website
   but I also hear that modern websites are using a lot more things than just HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
   My question is what are these things like node.js and other frameworks?
   Is it right to call them frameworks or are they something else?
   Why are there so many of them and what do they do?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific.
   I would add icons to the buttons along with sounds to make recognition more easier.
   Like maybe fruit icons, banna for yellow, apple for pink, blueberry for blue, and watermelon for green.
   I think these changes would make memorizing the pattern much easier rather than going off of sound and button colors.
